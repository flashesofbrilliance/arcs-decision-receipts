# ARCS Decision Receipts: Catalyst Infrastructure

This repository contains the core logic for the ARCS (Abductive Reconnaissance Coherence System) Catalyst framework. It helps turn flashes of brilliance into scalable organizational infrastructure.

## Installation

- With pip (editable for development):
  - `pip install -e .[dev]`

## Usage

- Kryptonite Scorer CLI:
  - `python -m arcs_decision_receipts.kryptonite_scorer --jd "text..." --type startup`

- Waveform Optimizer (Python):
  - `from arcs_decision_receipts import model_decision_wave`
  - `t, wave = model_decision_wave(freq=1.5, amp=0.8, damping=0.2)`

## Project Structure

- `src/arcs_decision_receipts/` — package modules
- `tests/` — pytest-based tests
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint and test on push/PR

## Development

- Lint: `ruff check .`
- Test: `pytest -q`

## Core Archetypes

- Cognitive Synthesizer — decision graph mapping
- Swiss Army Knife — cross-functional execution
- Entropy Reducer — stabilize scaling and velocity
