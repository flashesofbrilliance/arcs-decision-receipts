# ARCS Decision Receipts: Catalyst Infrastructure

This repository contains the core logic for the **ARCS (Abductive Reconnaissance Coherence System)** Catalyst framework. It is designed to turn 'Flashes of Brilliance' into scalable organizational infrastructure.

## Core Archetypes
- **Cognitive Synthesizer:** Mapping the organizational decision graph.
- **Swiss Army Knife:** Cross-functional execution in Product, Strategy, and Risk.
- **Entropy Reducer:** Fixed chaos, stabilized scaling, and accelerated velocity.

## Tools
- `kryptonite_scorer.py`: Evaluates 'Revealed Preference' vs. 'Stated Need' in job descriptions.
- `waveform_optimizer.py`: Models decision resonance using Frequency, Amplitude, and Damping.
